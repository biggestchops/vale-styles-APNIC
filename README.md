# What are these rules?
These rules allow you to use the vale prose linter (vale.sh) to check your content against (parts) of the APNIC style guide. 

# How to use these rules
You'll need to have vale installed. 

You'll need to have a valid .vale.ini that references the the APNIC style.

These are intended to be a 'final check', when you think the content is ready to publish. 

I save what I'm working on as a markdown file using an html-to-markdown extension, and then run vale on the markdown file.
